# S9 R1 panel-review — Opus model-diversity lane (prompt pack)

You are the **Claude/Opus** leg of the S9 three-lane adversarial panel (1 Claude + 2 Codex, R1). The two Codex lanes carry the A (support/quote-fidelity) and B (currency/treatment) attack lenses; **you carry model diversity and MUST vote on every paneled assertion across BOTH lenses' concerns.** You are refute-framed: try hard to break each assertion; **default to REFUTED on uncertainty**; never fabricate a cite, quote, or holding; use ONLY the evidence inlined below (no search, no outside knowledge). You are a SIGHTED reviewer — the FULL lake record (judgment fields included) is inlined.

You are a WRITER lane, not an adjudicator: you FIND and VOTE. You do not tally, adjudicate, or close any row — the orchestrator does.

For EACH group below, return one JSON object with the exact `reviewed[]` shape from the output contract (identical framing to the Codex lenses). Emit a finding object ONLY for a real defect (verdict refuted / stands-modified); a group you find wholly clean returns all-`stands` verdicts (the harness records a clean attestation). Concatenate the per-group JSON objects into a top-level `{"packs": [ ... ]}` array, one entry per group, each carrying its `group_id`.


OUTPUT CONTRACT — return ONE JSON object, nothing else:
{
  "lens": "A" | "B",
  "group_id": "<echo the group id>",
  "reviewed": [
    {
      "assertion_id": "<from group_inventory.jsonl>",
      "dimension": "existence|support|quote_fidelity|pincite|treatment|black_letter",
      "verdict": "stands" | "refuted" | "stands-modified",
      "verifiable_from_disclosed": true | false,
      "defect": null,   // null when verdict=="stands"; else an object:
      //  {"problem": "...", "severity": "high|medium|low", "proposed_fix": "...", "evidence_quote": "verbatim from disclosed evidence or null", "needs_cl": true|false, "locator_note": "..."}
      "reasons": ["short evidence-grounded reason", "..."],
      "breaks_true_positives": true | false,
      "residual_risks": ["..."],
      "suggested_tightening": "... or null"
    }
  ],
  "notes": ""
}
Rules: verdict=='stands' <=> defect==null (assertion survives your attack). verdict=='refuted' <=> a real defect (the assertion as framed is wrong). verdict=='stands-modified' <=> survives but needs a stated modification (a minor defect). Review EVERY assertion_id in group_inventory.jsonl exactly once. Output ONLY the JSON object.

# Cell-Site Simulators

*The officers are not asking a carrier for records — they are running a device that impersonates a cell tower to make the target's phone reveal itself and its location, including inside a home. Does that require a warrant?*

> [!rule] Black-letter rule
> A **cell-site simulator** (a "StingRay" or IMSI catcher) mimics a cellular tower, forcing nearby phones to connect and disclose their identifiers and precise location. There is **no controlling Supreme Court decision**, but the governing analogies point one way: using the device to locate a phone **inside a home or other protected space** reveals "a critical fact about the interior" and is a search (*[[United States v. Karo#^pin-715|United States v. Karo]]*, 468 U.S. at [715](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111257/united-states-v-karo/)), as is aiming sense-enhancing technology "not in general public use" at a home (*[[Kyllo v. United States|Kyllo v. United States]]*, 533 U.S. 27, [34](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118443/kyllo-v-united-states/) (2001)); and locating a specific phone tracks the comprehensive-location concern of *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]*. Federal policy (DOJ and DHS, 2015) requires a **search warrant** for cell-site-simulator use absent [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]], and the leading state decision agrees. Treat cell-site-simulator deployment as **warrant-requiring**, and the precise constitutional rule as **unsettled**.

## The Brief

**What the device does, and why it is different.** A cell-site simulator broadcasts a signal stronger than the surrounding towers, so every phone in range connects to it instead. That lets officers identify a target phone's unique subscriber number and pinpoint its location in real time, often to a specific unit in an apartment building, and in doing so it sweeps in every other phone nearby. Unlike a request to a carrier, this is direct government interception of signals the phone emits, deployed by officers in the field.

**No SCOTUS holding; the rule is built from analogy.** No Supreme Court case addresses cell-site simulators. The doctrine is assembled from three anchors. *[[United States v. Karo|Karo]]* supplies the decisive move for the common use — locating a phone **inside a residence**: a technique that reveals an interior fact "the Government could not have otherwise obtained without a warrant" is a search. *[[United States v. Karo#^pin-715|Karo]]*, 468 U.S. at [715](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111257/united-states-v-karo/). *[[Kyllo v. United States|Kyllo]]* adds that using a device "not in general public use" to learn what is happening inside a home is a search, whatever the device. And *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]*'s concern with pinpoint location over time reinforces that real-time location of a person's phone is constitutionally weighty. Together they make cell-site-simulator use to find a phone in a protected space a search requiring a warrant.

**Policy has run ahead of case law.** Since 2015, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security policy has required a **search warrant** based on probable cause before federal agents deploy a cell-site simulator, except in genuine [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigencies]], and requires deletion of incidentally collected third-party data. Several states have enacted equivalent statutory warrant requirements. These policies are not constitutional holdings, but they are the operative rule in practice and reflect the consensus that the device's power demands a warrant.

**The dragnet problem is unresolved.** Because the simulator forces *all* nearby phones to connect, its use is a mass, if momentary, interception. Courts have not settled how the Fourth Amendment treats the bystander phones swept in, and suppression litigation has often turned on good faith or on the government's reluctance to disclose the technique at all. Present the bystander-collection question as open.

**Apply it.**
1. **Identify the technique.** If officers used a device that impersonates a tower to locate a phone (not a records request to a carrier), this is the cell-site-simulator rule, not ordinary CSLI.
2. **Locate the phone.** If the device was used to find the phone inside a home or other protected space, *[[United States v. Karo|Karo]]* and *[[Kyllo v. United States|Kyllo]]* make it a search requiring a warrant.
3. **Check for a warrant and policy compliance.** Absent [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]], DOJ/DHS policy and the leading state authority require a probable-cause warrant; a warrantless deployment is the litigable event.
4. **Flag the bystander sweep.** Note that the device collected data from other phones; the treatment of that incidental collection is unsettled.

**Common pitfalls.**
- **Treating cell-site-simulator use as ordinary third-party CSLI.** It is direct government interception in the field, not a request for a carrier's business records; *[[Smith v. Maryland|Smith]]*/*[[United States v. Miller|Miller]]* do not govern it.
- **Assuming there is a Supreme Court rule.** There is none; the rule is built from *[[United States v. Karo|Karo]]*, *[[Kyllo v. United States|Kyllo]]*, and *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]* plus policy and lower-court law.
- **Overlooking the interior move.** The strongest warrant argument is *[[United States v. Karo|Karo]]*'s: the device revealed the phone's location inside a protected space.

## Lower-court developments

- **Leading state decision — warrant required.** *State v. Andrews* (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2016) held that real-time use of a cell-site simulator to locate a suspect's phone was a Fourth Amendment search requiring a warrant, and that the State's failure to disclose the technique to the issuing court could not be cured. It remains the most-cited judicial statement that cell-site-simulator deployment needs a warrant.
- **Federal and state policy.** DOJ (Sept. 2015) and DHS (Oct. 2015) policies require a probable-cause search warrant for cell-site-simulator use absent [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigent circumstances]], plus prompt deletion of non-target data; a number of states have codified parallel warrant requirements. These are the operative constraints most agencies work under.

The picture: no Supreme Court rule, a strong analogical case for a warrant (*[[United States v. Karo|Karo]]*/*[[Kyllo v. United States|Kyllo]]*), executive policy that already requires one, and an unresolved question about the bystander phones the device sweeps in.

# Investigative Genetic Genealogy

*Police upload a crime-scene DNA profile to a consumer ancestry database, find distant relatives of the unknown contributor, and build a family tree back to a suspect. Whose Fourth Amendment rights, if anyone's, does that implicate — and is there any settled answer yet?*

> [!rule] Black-letter rule
> **Investigative genetic genealogy (IGG)** identifies an unknown DNA contributor by matching a crime-scene profile against **consumer genealogy databases** (such as GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA) to find relatives, then reverse-engineering a family tree to the suspect. There is **no controlling Supreme Court or federal appellate decision** on whether IGG is a Fourth Amendment search, and the question is genuinely **unsettled**. The competing frames are the **third-party doctrine** (the relatives voluntarily uploaded their own DNA, arguably defeating any expectation of privacy in the shared segments), **standing** (a suspect ordinarily cannot challenge a search of someone else's uploaded profile), and *[[Maryland v. King|Maryland v. King]]*, 569 U.S. 435 (2013) (DNA identification as a reasonable law-enforcement practice) — cut against the sensitivity concerns of *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]*. Federal use runs under **DOJ interim policy (2019)**, not a constitutional holding.

## The Brief

**What IGG is.** IGG is not database matching against government DNA banks (CODIS); it is the use of **private, consumer-facing** genealogy databases, into which millions of people have uploaded their own genetic data to find relatives. Investigators upload a profile derived from crime-scene evidence, receive a list of partial matches (relatives who share DNA), and then use conventional genealogy (public records, family trees) to work inward to a single suspect, whose identity is confirmed by a fresh, directly obtained DNA sample. The 2018 Golden State Killer investigation, which identified a long-sought suspect through GEDmatch, was the breakthrough that brought the technique into wide use.

**Why the Fourth Amendment answer is unsettled.** No Supreme Court or circuit decision squarely holds whether IGG is a search, and the doctrine could break several ways. The **third-party doctrine** suggests the relatives who uploaded their DNA assumed the risk of disclosure, so the matching invades no protected interest; but the person ultimately identified never uploaded anything, and it is his genetic information, exposed through relatives, that the technique exploits. **Standing** narrows the field further: under ordinary [[Standing to Challenge a Search|Fourth Amendment standing]], a suspect cannot vicariously challenge a search of a relative's account, which may leave the database search effectively unreviewable at his instance. And *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]*'s reasoning (that comprehensive, revealing digital data can carry a privacy interest even in a third party's hands) pushes the other way, since few data types are more intimate than a genetic profile.

**The DNA anchor that does exist.** The closest Supreme Court authority is *[[Maryland v. King]]*, which upheld taking a buccal DNA swab from a felony arrestee as a reasonable booking procedure, treating DNA identification as a legitimate, limited law-enforcement tool. *[[Maryland v. King|King]]* is not an IGG case (it concerns compelled collection from an arrestee, not matching against consumer databases), but it frames DNA identification as constitutionally tolerable in principle, and both sides cite it. The **abandoned-DNA** line (that a person retains no expectation of privacy in genetic material shed on a discarded item) is the other analogy invoked to defeat a privacy claim.

**Policy fills the constitutional vacuum.** Because the law is unresolved, the operative constraints are policy and provider terms. The Department of Justice's 2019 interim policy limits federal IGG to violent crimes and unidentified remains, requires that the profile be worked only in databases whose terms permit law-enforcement use, and bars covert uploads to services that forbid them. GEDmatch and other providers have changed their terms to require user opt-in for law-enforcement matching. These are not Fourth Amendment holdings, but they are the rules agencies actually follow.

**Apply it.**
1. **Distinguish IGG from CODIS matching.** IGG uses **private consumer** databases and relative-matching; it is not a hit against a government DNA bank.
2. **Spot the whose-rights problem.** The person identified did not upload his DNA; analyze both the uploading relatives' interests and the suspect's, and expect a standing obstacle to the suspect's challenge.
3. **Run the competing analogies.** Third-party doctrine and abandoned-DNA cut against a privacy claim; *[[Carpenter v. United States|Carpenter]]*'s sensitivity reasoning cuts for one. There is no controlling answer.
4. **Check policy and terms of service.** Federal IGG must comply with the 2019 DOJ interim policy and the database's law-enforcement terms; a violation of those is often the most concrete objection available.

**Common pitfalls.**
- **Stating that IGG is (or is not) a search as settled law.** It is unresolved; no Supreme Court or circuit decision controls.
- **Confusing IGG with CODIS or arrestee-swab law.** *[[Maryland v. King]]* governs compelled arrestee collection, not consumer-database matching.
- **Assuming the suspect can suppress the database search.** Standing usually blocks a challenge to a relative's uploaded profile; the objection more often runs to policy or to the later, directly obtained sample.
