# S9 R1 panel-review — Opus model-diversity lane (prompt pack)

You are the **Claude/Opus** leg of the S9 three-lane adversarial panel (1 Claude + 2 Codex, R1). The two Codex lanes carry the A (support/quote-fidelity) and B (currency/treatment) attack lenses; **you carry model diversity and MUST vote on every paneled assertion across BOTH lenses' concerns.** You are refute-framed: try hard to break each assertion; **default to REFUTED on uncertainty**; never fabricate a cite, quote, or holding; use ONLY the evidence inlined below (no search, no outside knowledge). You are a SIGHTED reviewer — the FULL lake record (judgment fields included) is inlined.

You are a WRITER lane, not an adjudicator: you FIND and VOTE. You do not tally, adjudicate, or close any row — the orchestrator does.

For EACH group below, return one JSON object with the exact `reviewed[]` shape from the output contract (identical framing to the Codex lenses). Emit a finding object ONLY for a real defect (verdict refuted / stands-modified); a group you find wholly clean returns all-`stands` verdicts (the harness records a clean attestation). Concatenate the per-group JSON objects into a top-level `{"packs": [ ... ]}` array, one entry per group, each carrying its `group_id`.


OUTPUT CONTRACT — return ONE JSON object, nothing else:
{
  "lens": "A" | "B",
  "group_id": "<echo the group id>",
  "reviewed": [
    {
      "assertion_id": "<from group_inventory.jsonl>",
      "dimension": "existence|support|quote_fidelity|pincite|treatment|black_letter",

Rules: verdict=='stands' <=> defect==null (assertion survives your attack). verdict=='refuted' <=> a real defect (the assertion as framed is wrong). verdict=='stands-modified' <=> survives but needs a stated modification (a minor defect). Review EVERY assertion_id in group_inventory.jsonl exactly once. Output ONLY the JSON object.

# Entry to Arrest

*May police cross a home's threshold to make an arrest, and does forcing a suspect out from the outside count as an entry? This page fixes the entry authority; the reasonableness of the arrest itself lives on the pages it points to.*

> [!rule] Black-letter rule
> **Match the warrant to the home, and remember that a threshold can be crossed by force as well as by foot.** For the suspect's **own** dwelling, "an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within." *[[Payton v. New York]]*, 445 U.S. 573, [603](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110235/payton-v-new-york/) (1980). To arrest that suspect inside a **third party's** home, officers need a **search warrant** for the home. *[[Steagald v. United States#^pin-205|Steagald v. United States]]*, 451 U.S. 204, [205–06](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/) (1981). Absent a warrant the entry survives only on **consent** or a genuine **[[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]]**. The protection is not defeated by staying outside the doorway: police who mount a coercive show of force to draw a suspect out of a surrounded home effect a warrantless arrest "in the home" that *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* forbids, because it is the arrestee's location, not the officers', that fixes where the arrest occurs.
> ^rule-entry-to-arrest

## The Brief

**Two homes, two warrants.** Entry to arrest turns first on whose home the officer means to cross into. For the suspect's **own** dwelling, *[[Payton v. New York#^pin-590|Payton]]* draws "a firm line at the entrance to the house," and "[a]bsent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant." 445 U.S. at 590. An **arrest warrant** for the suspect carries the limited authority to enter his own home to serve it "when there is reason to believe the suspect is within." *Id.* at 603. That "reason to believe" quantum loads two predicates (the suspect **resides** there and is **presently home**) and divides the circuits; it is treated in full at [[Arrest in the Home]].

**A third party's home takes a search warrant.** An arrest warrant protects the person named in it, not the householder, so to look for the suspect inside **someone else's** home the officers need a **search warrant** for that home. *[[Steagald v. United States#^pin-205|Steagald v. United States]]*, 451 U.S. 204, [205–06](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/) (1981). Two protected interests then run at once: the homeowner's (*[[Steagald v. United States|Steagald]]*) and, if the suspect is an overnight guest, his own (*[[Minnesota v. Olson]]*; see [[Standing to Challenge a Search]]).

**No warrant means consent or a real [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]].** When officers have neither warrant, the entry stands only on **consent** or a genuine emergency (escape, imminent destruction of evidence, or danger), and the [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]] is gated by *[[United States v. Santana#^pin-43|Santana]]* (the doorway is public and [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|hot pursuit]] crosses it), *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin#^pin-753|Welsh]]* (a minor offense rarely justifies a home entry), *[[Kentucky v. King]]* (lawful police-created [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]] is fine, an unlawfully manufactured one is not), and *[[Lange v. California]]* (misdemeanor pursuit is case-by-case, not categorical). The full [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]] analysis lives at [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit]].

**The surround-and-call-out problem.** The hard modern question is whether officers who never step across the threshold can still make an "in-home" arrest by coercing the suspect out. They can. The Ninth Circuit's spine case is *[[United States v. Nora#^pin-1054|United States v. Nora]]*, 765 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2014): 20 to 30 officers surrounded a house with weapons drawn and a helicopter overhead, then ordered the occupant out over a public-address system. Because a suspect summoned from a surrounded home "is treated as arrested inside it unless he voluntarily exposed himself," the government had to justify a warrantless in-home arrest, and it could not. 765 F.3d at 1054.

**The containment-versus-exit-command line.** Whether an emergence is an in-home arrest turns on coercion, and the two poles are drawn by a matched pair. On the coerced-emergence side, *[[United States v. Al-Azzawy#^pin-894|Al-Azzawy]]* holds that where officers "completely surrounded appellee's trailer with their weapons drawn and ordered him through a bullhorn to leave," a suspect who "did not voluntarily expose himself ... but only emerged under circumstances of extreme coercion" was "arrested while he was still inside his trailer." 784 F.2d 890, 894–95 (9th Cir. 1986). On the voluntary-exposure side, *[[United States v. Vaneaton#^pin-1426|Vaneaton]]* holds that a suspect who freely opens his door to a "noncoercive knock" and is arrested at the open doorway has "voluntarily exposed himself to warrantless arrest," so *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* is not offended. 49 F.3d 1423, 1426–27 (9th Cir. 1995). The question is never the suspect's exact inches from the sill; it is whether the exit was commanded or chosen.

**The perimeter defeats the flight [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]].** The tactic that makes a surround-and-call-out powerful is also what disarms the government's usual excuse. In *[[United States v. Nora|Nora]]* the court found no danger to others and held that "the officers had no reason to believe Nora might pose a danger to the public by attempting to flee, since they had the house completely surrounded and could monitor all exit points." 765 F.3d at 1055. A complete perimeter with monitored exits forecloses escape, so the containment the officers rely on to justify skipping the warrant is the very fact that negates a flight-based [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]]. A **present, articulated danger** is different: *[[United States v. Al-Azzawy|Al-Azzawy]]* itself reversed suppression because reported grenades and threats to blow up the trailer park supplied a real [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]] that excused the warrantless in-home arrest. 784 F.2d at 895.

**The remedy is bounded to the home.** A *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* violation suppresses only what the unlawful entry produced **inside** the home. Where officers had **probable cause** to arrest, the violation does not bar a statement the suspect later makes **outside**: "the exclusionary rule does not bar the State's use of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of *Payton*." *[[New York v. Harris#^pin-21|New York v. Harris]]*, 495 U.S. 14, [21](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112413/new-york-v-harris/) (1990). A later, properly-Mirandized station-house statement in lawful custody is not the fruit of "having been arrested in the home rather than someplace else." *Id.* at 19.

**Common pitfalls.**
- **Thinking the officer's body must cross the line before *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* applies.** A surround-and-call-out that coerces the suspect out is an in-home arrest even though no officer steps inside; the arrestee's location controls. *[[United States v. Nora]]*; *[[United States v. Maez]]*.
- **Reading a doorway arrest as automatically lawful.** A suspect who **voluntarily** opens to a noncoercive knock exposes himself (*[[United States v. Vaneaton]]*), but one who emerges under an overwhelming show of force does not (*[[United States v. Al-Azzawy]]*). The line is coercion, not the threshold.
- **Using the perimeter as the [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]].** A completely surrounded house with monitored exits *removes* the flight risk; officers cannot invoke the containment they created as the emergency that excuses the warrant. *[[United States v. Nora]]*.
- **Using an arrest warrant to enter a third party's home.** That is a *[[Steagald v. United States|Steagald]]* violation; the home needs its own **search warrant**.
- **Assuming a *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* violation suppresses everything.** Under *[[New York v. Harris]]* a station-house statement made on probable cause survives; the remedy reaches only the in-home fruits.

## Lower-court developments

The Supreme Court has never decided whether coercing a suspect out of a surrounded home is a *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* in-home arrest, and the circuits divide. The decisions below are **Binding in-circuit** within their own circuits and **Persuasive (outside circuit)** elsewhere; the split is real, so never state one circuit's rule as national law.

- **Recognizing side (coerced emergence is a *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]* in-home arrest).** The **Ninth Circuit** anchors it (*[[United States v. Nora|Nora]]*, *[[United States v. Al-Azzawy|Al-Azzawy]]*, with *[[United States v. Vaneaton|Vaneaton]]* marking the voluntary-exposure limit) and the **Tenth Circuit** joins (*[[United States v. Maez|Maez]]*, 872 F.2d 1444, 1451: a SWAT team's loudspeaker order to come out was a warrantless in-home arrest even though no officer went to the door). The **Second Circuit** is in accord: officers who summon a suspect to his door "may not effect a warrantless 'across the threshold' arrest in the absence of exigent circumstances." *United States v. Allen*, 813 F.3d 76, 84–86 (2d Cir. 2016). The **Sixth Circuit** aligns as well (its representative decision is not mapped in this build).
- **Narrow side (the officer's body, not his voice, must cross the threshold).** The **Eleventh Circuit** holds that "*Payton* keeps the officer's body outside the threshold, not his voice," so an officer may tell a suspect to step outside and then arrest him without a warrant. *[[Knight v. Jacobson|Knight v. Jacobson]]*, 300 F.3d 1272, 1277 (11th Cir. 2002). The **Seventh Circuit** draws the same voice-versus-entry line, validating an announced-from-outside doorway surrender but condemning a warrantless entry made *before* the arrest, and remanding to find which occurred. *[[United States v. Berkowitz|United States v. Berkowitz]]*, 927 F.2d 1376, 1386 (7th Cir. 1991). The **Fifth Circuit** is generally grouped on this side (its representative decision is not mapped in this build).
- **Unmapped.** The **First, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits** have no representative constructive-entry decision mapped in this build; do not assume how they come out.
- **[[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|Exigency]] counterpoint.** An armed standoff can supply the [[Exigent Circumstances and Hot Pursuit|exigency]] a bare perimeter cannot: the Ninth Circuit, [[Reading and Citing Cases#en-banc|en banc]], treated an armed suspect's refusal to surrender as an exigent circumstance in *Fisher v. City of San Jose*, 558 F.3d 1069, 1074–79 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). It refines rather than contradicts *[[United States v. Nora|Nora]]*, which turned on the **absence** of any present danger.

Without an arrest warrant and without consent or exigent circumstances, three officers entered Harris's home, read him his *Miranda* rights, and obtained an admission inside the home (a *Payton* violation; that in-home statement was suppressed, which the State conceded). They then took Harris to the station house, again administered *Miranda* warnings, and Harris signed a written inculpatory statement. New York's courts suppressed the station-house statement as the fruit of the unlawful in-home arrest. ## Issue Whether the exclusionary rule requires suppression of a statement a defendant makes at the police station, after a warrantless in-home arrest that violated *Payton*, when the police had probable cause to arrest him. ## Rule No.",

In Payton's case, detectives had probable cause that Theodore Payton murdered a gas-station manager; at 7:30 a.m. six officers went to his Bronx apartment without a warrant, got no answer, broke open the door, and seized a shell casing in plain view. (The consolidated *Riddick* case involved a similar warrantless home arrest.) ## Issue Whether the Fourth Amendment permits police to make a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's own home in order to make a routine felony arrest. ## Rule No. The Fourth Amendment",

Acting on the report, police checked the car's registration, went to Welsh's house without a warrant, entered, found him in his upstairs bedroom, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. Under Wisconsin law, a first DWI offense was a noncriminal civil forfeiture punishable only by a fine, with no possible imprisonment. ## Issue Whether police may make a warrantless, nighttime entry into a suspect's home to arrest him for a minor, noncriminal traffic offense, on the theory that exigent circumstances (preserving blood-alcohol evidence) justified the entry. ## Rule The seriousness of the crime bears directly on whether an exigency justifies a warrantless home entry: the Court",

# Exigent Circumstances — Hot Pursuit

*Is there a true emergency that lets me chase a fleeing suspect across a threshold without a warrant, and how far does it go?*

> [!rule] Black-letter rule
> Where police have **probable cause**, a warrantless entry and search is reasonable when "the exigencies of the situation make[] that course imperative." *[[Warden v. Hayden#^pin-298|Warden v. Hayden]]*, 387 U.S. 294, [298](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107465/warden-maryland-penitentiary-v-hayden/) (1967). **Hot (and fresh) pursuit** of a fleeing suspect is one recognized exigency: a suspect cannot defeat an arrest set in motion in a public place by retreating into a home (*[[United States v. Santana#^pin-43|Santana]]*), but pursuit of a fleeing **misdemeanant** is **not** categorical and is judged case-by-case (*[[Lange v. California]]*). Two outer limits run through every exigency at once — the **gravity of the offense** (*[[Welsh v. Wisconsin|Welsh]]*) and the **no-police-created-exigency** rule (*[[Kentucky v. King|King]]*) — and the permissible scope is always tethered to the emergency.

**What it is.** Exigent circumstances are a recognized exception to [[The Warrant Requirement]]: with **probable cause**, a warrantless entry and search is reasonable when the emergency makes getting a warrant impracticable. There is no per-se exigency that fires automatically; the exigency must be **genuine**, judged on the [[Common Legal Terms#totality-of-the-circumstances|totality of the circumstances]]. Three exigencies are recognized: **(1) hot (and fresh) pursuit** of a fleeing suspect (this page); **(2) the imminent destruction of evidence** ([[Destruction of Evidence]]); and **(3) a risk to life or safety / the need to render [[Emergency Aid|emergency aid]]** ([[Emergency Aid]]). This page owns the pursuit branch and the framework that governs all three.

**Burden · standard of review.** Because a warrantless home entry is presumptively unreasonable, the **government bears the burden** of proving a recognized exigency justified it; the defendant need not disprove one. That burden is heavy: the police "bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests." *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin|Welsh v. Wisconsin]]*, 466 U.S. 740, [749–50](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111173/welsh-v-wisconsin/) (1984); *[[Mincey v. Arizona|Mincey v. Arizona]]*, 437 U.S. 385, [390–91](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109905/mincey-v-arizona/) (1978). On appeal, suppression rulings get a mixed standard: historical facts for [[Common Legal Terms#clear-error|clear error]], the ultimate reasonableness/exigency question [[Common Legal Terms#de-novo|de novo]]. The **remedy** for an unjustified warrantless entry is suppression of the evidence and its fruits under [[The Exclusionary Rule]].

**Hot pursuit, and the hot-versus-fresh line.** Hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect into a dwelling is valid where the emergency leaves no time for a warrant. In *[[Warden v. Hayden|Hayden]]* officers entered a house minutes behind an armed robber reported to have just gone in; "neither the entry without warrant to search for the robber, nor the search for him without warrant was invalid," because "the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative," and the Fourth Amendment "does not require police officers to delay . . . if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others." *[[Warden v. Hayden#^pin-299|Id.]]* at 298–99. *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]* extends the principle to a suspect who retreats from her own threshold: a doorway is a "public" place, and "a suspect may not defeat an arrest which has been set in motion in a public place . . . by the expedient of escaping to a private place." *[[United States v. Santana#^pin-43|United States v. Santana]]*, 427 U.S. 38, [43](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109504/united-states-v-santana/) (1976). That the "pursuit here ended almost as soon as it began did not render it any the less a 'hot pursuit.'" *Id.*

**Teaching line (Bandiero): "hot on the tail, fresh on the trail."** The mnemonic keeps a real distinction straight. **Hot pursuit** is an *immediate and continuous* pursuit of a suspect from the scene of the crime, ongoing at the moment of entry (the *[[Warden v. Hayden|Hayden]]* / *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]* situation). **Fresh pursuit** is a *promptly-resumed* pursuit after a brief interruption (and, in its common-law/statutory cross-jurisdictional sense, a pursuit an officer may carry across jurisdictional lines). The dividing question is **continuity**: a short pause does not necessarily break the chase, as the circuit development below (*[[Newman v. Underhill|Newman]]*) illustrates.

**Santana is point-scoped: good in part, limited by *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* in part.** *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]*'s validity **varies by point**. Its doorway-is-public holding and its **felony** hot-pursuit holding stand; what *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* cut down is the once-common **broad reading** that *any* fleeing-suspect pursuit categorically crosses the threshold.

| Point of law | Status | Controlling authority |
|---|---|---|
| A suspect standing in her own doorway is in a "public place" and cannot defeat a set-in-motion public arrest by retreating inside | **Good law** | *[[United States v. Santana]]*, 427 U.S. 38, [42–43](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109504/united-states-v-santana/) (1976) |
| Hot pursuit of a fleeing **felony** suspect follows across the threshold | **Good law**, with *[[Lange v. California\|Lange]]*'s express reservation of the fleeing-felon question noted | *[[United States v. Santana]]*, 427 U.S. at [43](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109504/united-states-v-santana/); *[[Lange v. California]]* reserved that question, 594 U.S. at 303–04 |
| Broad reading: **any** fleeing-suspect pursuit is a categorical exigency that crosses the threshold | **Limited by *Lange*** | *[[Lange v. California]]*, 594 U.S. 295, [313](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4894407/lange-v-california/) (2021) (misdemeanor flight is not categorical; case-by-case) |

*[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* holds that "pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect" does not "categorically . . . qualif[y] as an exigent circumstance," and that whether a given misdemeanor chase carries an exigency turns on a **case-by-case** assessment. *[[Lange v. California|Lange v. California]]*, 594 U.S. 295, [313](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4894407/lange-v-california/) (2021). **Why this changes the field call:** before *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]*, *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]*'s broad fleeing-suspect language was read to take any pursuit across the threshold; after *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]*, a chase into the home behind a fleeing **misdemeanant** is no longer automatically lawful, and the officer must articulate an actual exigency (escape, imminent harm, or evidence loss). *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]*'s doorway and **felony** hot-pursuit holdings are undisturbed; the automatic-misdemeanor-entry reading is gone. (*[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* left the fleeing-**felon** rule expressly reserved, so it is settled in practice but not squarely decided; see the pending-marker note.)

**The other exigencies, in brief.** The **evidence-destruction** branch (the dissipating-alcohol line and the no-police-created-exigency rule) is developed on [[Destruction of Evidence]]. The **life-safety / emergency-aid** branch is governed by an objective standard:

> [!rule] Black-letter rule — stated on [[Emergency Aid]]
> ![[warrant-exceptions/home-entry-and-search/Emergency Aid#^rule-emergency-aid]]

Develop these on [[Emergency Aid]]; note there is **no** freestanding "community caretaking" power to cross a home's threshold. *[[Caniglia v. Strom|Caniglia v. Strom]]*, 593 U.S. 194 (2021).

**The outer limit on all three: no police-created exigency.** Officers may rely on an exigency their own conduct prompted **unless** the police "create[d] the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment." *[[Kentucky v. King|Kentucky v. King]]*, 563 U.S. 452, [462](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/216733/kentucky-v-king/) (2011). Lawful [[Knock-and-Announce|knock-and-announce]], conduct any private citizen may do, does **not** manufacture the exigency, even when it prompts occupants to start destroying evidence; that lawful knock is the [[Knock and Talk]] approach. What forfeits the exception is creating the emergency through an actual or threatened **constitutional violation** (developed with the destruction cases on [[Destruction of Evidence]]).

**The other outer limit: gravity of the offense.** "[A]n important factor . . . is the gravity of the underlying offense," and the exception "should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . has been committed." *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin#^pin-753|Welsh v. Wisconsin]]*, 466 U.S. 740, [753](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111173/welsh-v-wisconsin/) (1984). A warrantless home arrest for such an offense is "clearly prohibited by the special protection afforded the individual in his home." *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin#^pin-755|Id.]]* at 755. A minor offense drags the whole exigency analysis toward *unreasonable* and reinforces *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]*'s caution about misdemeanor pursuits.

**Scope is tethered to the exigency; there is no "seriousness" exception.** The search a true exigency authorizes is bounded by the emergency that justified entering: in *[[Warden v. Hayden|Hayden]]* the search reached only the robber and his weapons. The gravity of the suspected crime never substitutes for a real emergency; there is no "murder scene" exigency exception, so warrantless entry must rest on a genuine emergency and any further search needs a warrant. *[[Mincey v. Arizona|Mincey v. Arizona]]*, 437 U.S. 385 (1978). And where the need is to **preserve** evidence rather than search now, the measured response is the **less-intrusive freeze**: with probable cause and a genuine risk of destruction, officers may temporarily restrain a resident from re-entering, or secure the premises from within, **while they get a warrant**. *[[Illinois v. McArthur|Illinois v. McArthur]]*, 531 U.S. 326 (2001); *[[Segura v. United States|Segura v. United States]]*, 468 U.S. 796 (1984). See [[Securing the Scene]].

**Apply it.**
1. Confirm **probable cause** first; without it there is no exigency exception.
2. Identify the exigency: pursuit (this page), destruction ([[Destruction of Evidence]]), or life-safety ([[Emergency Aid]]).
3. For pursuit, check **continuity**: was the chase immediate and continuous from the scene at the moment of entry?
4. Check the **offense**: for a fleeing misdemeanant there is no categorical entry; articulate a real, case-specific exigency (*[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* · *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin|Welsh]]*).
5. Confirm you did not **manufacture** the exigency by threatening a Fourth Amendment violation (*[[Kentucky v. King|King]]*).
6. Keep the **scope** tied to the emergency; if the need is only to preserve evidence, freeze and get a warrant (*[[Illinois v. McArthur|McArthur]]* · *[[Segura v. United States|Segura]]*; [[Securing the Scene]]).

**Common pitfalls.**
- **Treating any fleeing suspect as automatic entry.** After *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]* and *[[Welsh v. Wisconsin|Welsh]]*, flight (especially for a minor or misdemeanor offense) does not by itself open the door; articulate the specific exigency.
- **Manufacturing the exigency.** Under *[[Kentucky v. King|King]]*, an exigency created by threatening to breach the Fourth Amendment cannot justify the entry; lawful [[Knock-and-Announce|knock-and-announce]] can (*[[Destruction of Evidence]]*).
- **Letting a brief interruption fool you.** Whether a pause **breaks** a pursuit is about continuity (did officers keep a fix on the suspect and keep working?), not a stopwatch (*[[Newman v. Underhill|Newman]]*).
- **Conflating [[Emergency Aid|emergency aid]] with criminal exigency.** Entry to render aid is a noncriminal, objective-reasonableness justification (*[[Brigham City v. Stuart|Brigham City]]*); do not borrow it to justify an arrest entry, and remember the home gets no freestanding caretaking entry (*[[Caniglia v. Strom|Caniglia]]*).
- **Forgetting the boundaries.** Authority to enter to **arrest on a warrant** is *[[Payton v. New York|Payton]]*/*[[Steagald v. United States|Steagald]]* territory ([[Arrest in the Home]]); what officers may do once lawfully inside (sweeps, freezes) is [[Securing the Scene]]; vehicle mobility is the [[Automobile Exception]].

## Lower-court developments

Role-based, circuit/state only (**no SCOTUS**; a Supreme Court holding belongs in Key cases regardless of date). The cases below are **Binding in-circuit** within their own circuit and **Persuasive (outside circuit)** elsewhere; none states nationwide law. Recent circuit law continues to apply the *[[Warden v. Hayden|Hayden]]* / *[[United States v. Santana|Santana]]* continuity requirement on a fact-specific basis.

- ***[[Newman v. Underhill|Newman v. Underhill]]* (9th Cir. 2025)** — *applies / illustrates the continuity-of-pursuit (hot-versus-fresh) requirement.* A roughly nine-minute delay and loss of sight, during which the deputy waited for backup, did **not** break the continuity of an "immediate and continuous" hot pursuit of a felony evader, where the deputy kept a reasonably good idea of the suspect's location and spent the time actively working to find and apprehend him (a delay far shorter than the thirty-minute gap that had broken continuity in circuit precedent). Warrantless entry into the home where the suspect was reasonably believed to be was a valid exigent hot-pursuit entry. Because the offense was a **felony**, *[[Lange v. California|Lange]]*'s misdemeanor limit was not implicated. **Binding in-circuit — 9th Cir.** · good. [opinion](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/10382777/newman-v-underhill/)

A warrant issued, the search found marijuana and a pipe, and McArthur moved to suppress the temporary restraint as unreasonable. ## Issue Whether police with probable cause may temporarily prevent a resident from entering his home unaccompanied, to avoid the destruction of evidence, while they diligently obtain a search warrant. ## Rule Yes, on these combined circumstances.",

Rather than stopping, Lange drove into his attached garage. The officer followed him in, questioned him, observed signs of intoxication, and a later blood test showed Lange was over the legal limit. He was charged with the misdemeanor of driving under the influence. ## Issue Whether the pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect categorically (always) qualifies as an exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless entry into the home. ## Rule No \u2014 there is no categorical rule; exigency is judged case by case.",

In Payton's case, detectives had probable cause that Theodore Payton murdered a gas-station manager; at 7:30 a.m. six officers went to his Bronx apartment without a warrant, got no answer, broke open the door, and seized a shell casing in plain view.

Two cab drivers followed him and radioed his description and the address of the house he entered. Police arrived within minutes, were told an armed suspect had just gone in, and entered without a warrant. Searching the house for the robber and his weapons, they found Hayden feigning sleep in an upstairs bedroom, a shotgun and pistol in a flush tank, ammunition, and clothing matching the robber's description in a washing machine. All were used to convict him. ## Issue Whether the warrantless entry into and search of a house, in immediate pursuit of an armed robber reported to have entered moments earlier, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. ## Rule Hot pursuit of a fleeing armed suspect into a dwelling is a valid warrantless entry and search where the exigencies make it imperative:",

Acting on the report, police checked the car's registration, went to Welsh's house without a warrant, entered, found him in his upstairs bedroom, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. Under Wisconsin law, a first DWI offense was a noncriminal civil forfeiture punishable only by a fine, with no possible imprisonment. ## Issue Whether police may make a warrantless, nighttime entry into a suspect's home to arrest him for a minor, noncriminal traffic offense, on the theory that exigent circumstances (preserving blood-alcohol evidence) justified the entry. ## Rule The seriousness of the crime bears directly on whether an exigency justifies a warrantless home entry: the Court",
