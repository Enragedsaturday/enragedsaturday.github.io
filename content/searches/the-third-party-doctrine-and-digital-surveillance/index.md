# The Third-Party Doctrine and Digital Surveillance

## The Brief

**Field-decisive question:** *Did the suspect voluntarily convey this information to a third party — and if what I want is long-term, comprehensive digital location data, does* Carpenter *require a warrant anyway?*

**The black-letter rule.** Under the federal **third-party doctrine**, a person has **no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily turned over to a third party**, so the government may obtain it without a warrant. *[[Smith v. Maryland#Rule|Smith v. Maryland]]* states it directly: "a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties." The twin pillars are *[[Smith v. Maryland]]* (the numbers a caller dials, captured by a pen register) and *[[United States v. Miller]]* (bank records the customer exposed to the bank). The animating theory is **assumption of risk**: by handing information to a phone company, a bank, or any intermediary, you assume the risk that the recipient will reveal it to the government.

**The *Carpenter* digital limit (the modern dividing line).** *[[Carpenter v. United States#Rule|Carpenter v. United States]]* (2018) held that acquiring **historical cell-site location information (CSLI)** is a Fourth Amendment **search** that generally requires a **warrant** — the third-party doctrine does **not** mechanically extend to the comprehensive, automatically generated record of a person's physical movements. As the Court put it, an individual "maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through CSLI." Two points keep this disciplined. First, *Carpenter* did **not** overrule *Smith* or *Miller* — it carved a deliberately **narrow** exception for a "qualitatively different category" of digital data and left conventional surveillance and ordinary business records untouched. Second, the doctrine now runs on **two tracks**: ordinary records voluntarily conveyed to a third party (no warrant), versus comprehensive, auto-generated digital records of movement (warrant). The field call is deciding which track the data sits on.

**How to apply it.** Ask, in order: (1) Was the information **voluntarily conveyed** to a third party? If yes, the default is no REP and no warrant (*Smith*/*Miller*). (2) Is it instead a **comprehensive, automatically generated digital record** of the suspect's movements over time — the kind of "all-encompassing record" that provides "an intimate window into a person's life"? If yes, *Carpenter* treats acquisition as a search requiring a warrant. (3) For tracking devices specifically, mind the **home/public line**: tracking **public movements** is not a search (*[[United States v. Knotts#Rule|United States v. Knotts]]* — "no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements ... over public thoroughfares"), but using the device to reveal a fact about the **interior of a residence** is (*[[United States v. Karo#Rule|United States v. Karo]]* — the monitor "does reveal a critical fact about the interior of the premises").

**Burden, standard of review, remedy.** A defendant moving to suppress bears the **burden** of establishing a Fourth Amendment search — a legitimate expectation of privacy in the thing acquired; if the acquisition is not a search (third-party doctrine), there is nothing to suppress. On appeal, the legal conclusion (was there a search?) is reviewed **[[Common Legal Terms#de-novo|de novo]]** and the historical facts for **[[Common Legal Terms#clear-error|clear error]]**. The **remedy** when *Carpenter*'s line is crossed without a warrant is the ordinary one — **suppression** ([[The Exclusionary Rule]]) — subject to good-faith and the other exclusionary-rule exceptions, which is the escape hatch lower courts have leaned on in the geofence cases (see Recent developments).

**Limits, nuances, and pitfalls (woven in).** *Carpenter* is **narrow, not a repeal** — do not over-read it; *Smith* and *Miller* remain good law and govern conventional records. The widely taught "***Carpenter* prongs**" — (1) a new category of digital-age information, (2) generated without meaningful voluntary choice, (3) revealing "the privacies of life" — are **instructor framing, not the Court's holding**; the Court never enumerated a three-part test, and only "the privacies of life" is its own phrase. Label the gloss as a gloss, not a holding. **Scale / the mosaic is the dividing line for new technology**: a few fixed cameras capturing public movement tend to stay on the *Smith*/*Knotts* side (not a search), while comprehensive, city-wide, persistent tracking pulls toward *Carpenter*. **Sense-enhancing technology draws its own line** — *[[Kyllo v. United States]]* holds that using technology "not in general public use" to expose the interior of a home is a search, with *[[Dow Chemical Co. v. United States]]* the contrast (a commonly available aerial camera over commercial premises is not). And remember the **electronic-surveillance particularity baseline**: *[[Berger v. New York]]* struck down a permissive eavesdropping statute for lack of particularity and safeguards, setting the constitutional floor for electronic-surveillance warrants. Two field watch-outs: **do not state pole-camera, ALPR, or drone law as a settled federal rule** — each is split or unsettled and jurisdiction-dependent (Recent developments; the geofence *search* question, by contrast, is now settled by *[[Chatrie v. United States|Chatrie]]* (2026), though the probable-cause/particularity of geofence warrants remains open) — and **do not treat the manned-aircraft cases (*[[California v. Ciraolo]]*, *[[Florida v. Riley]]*) as drone law**; they predate drones and *Carpenter*, and low, persistent, zoom-capable drones may not fit them cleanly.

Role-based circuit/state law applying *Carpenter* to newer surveillance technology. None is SCOTUS; all are persuasive outside their issuing court, and the frontier is **unsettled** — present each as one court's position, not a national rule.

| *United States v.

**Geofence warrants (search question RESOLVED by SCOTUS) & long-term pole-camera surveillance (still split).** The **geofence search-threshold** question is **resolved**: in *[[Chatrie v. United States|Chatrie v. United States]]*, 609 U.S. ___ (2026), the Supreme Court held that acquiring Google Location History **is** a Fourth Amendment search — **applying/extending *Carpenter*** and rejecting the "voluntarily shared / opt-in / third-party" rationale — confirming the search-question result the 5th Circuit had reached in *United States v. Smith* and **superseding** the contrary 4th Circuit en banc *Chatrie* rationale. The Court did **not** adopt *Smith*'s further view that geofence warrants are categorically unconstitutional general warrants; the **live** geofence question is now the **probable cause + particularity** of such warrants, which *Chatrie* left open on remand. On **long-term pole cameras**, *United States v. Moore-Bush* (1st Cir., en banc) fractured 3–3 on whether sustained pole-camera surveillance of a home's exterior is a search after *Carpenter*, producing **no controlling majority rationale** — but **unanimously reversed** the suppression order and admitted the evidence under the *Davis* good-faith exception (reliance on then-binding circuit precedent), and it sits opposite the permissive 10th Circuit view in *Hay* above. That pole-camera split remains **open** (no SCOTUS resolution); *Moore-Bush* is annotate-only (no standalone page). **Drones** remain a further frontier — there is **no SCOTUS drone decision**, the manned-aircraft lineage (*Ciraolo*, *Riley*, *Dow Chemical*) is the bridge but may not fit, and some states are moving by statute or case law toward warrants for sustained curtilage surveillance; treat as jurisdiction-dependent and unsettled.
