# ESCALATION — Duplicate concurrent CL lane on S5 Phase-B batch 4

**Type:** orchestration / coordination (L4 single-serial-CL-lane violation)
**Raised by:** a second batch-4 lane (this agent) that stood down on discovery
**As of:** 2026-06-30 ~17:53 UTC

## What happened
This agent was dispatched as "the single serial CL lane" for **S5 Phase B, batch 4 — the next 18
not-yet-authored cases** in `_overhaul/coverage/ingest-queue.md` (Batch D: Chadwick → Case v. Montana,
plus Batch E: Go-Bart, Agnello, Shipley).

On reaching the WRITE step, every `content/cases/*.md` Write was correctly **blocked** ("file already
exists / not read"), revealing that **another lane is already executing the identical batch 4 in parallel**:

- `_overhaul/coverage/ingest-queue.md` is already marked **✅** for the first 9 (Chadwick, Cardwell,
  Michigan v. Thomas, Florida v. Myers→filed **Florida v. Meyers**, Maryland v. Dyson, Cooper v. California,
  Florida v. White, Harris v. United States (1968), Cupp v. Murphy).
- `_overhaul/ledger/cl-calls.log` shows that lane's live CL verifications for those same cases
  (timestamps 1782900500–1782901000), including a logged **"TRANSIENT PROXY OUTAGE: ~6 consecutive CL
  calls failed"** — consistent with **two lanes hitting CourtListener at once**.
- The 9 pages already written are **complete and to spec** (identity_checked:true; non-blank treatment;
  all 8 BIRAC sections; verbatim `^pin-N` anchors). The other lane's framing is in places more careful
  than this agent's draft (e.g. it caught that Harris (1968)'s queue one-liner "during a lawful inventory"
  is imprecise — the Court expressly *reserved* the inventory question — and reframed it as a
  protective-measure discovery + plain view, home-by-holding upgraded to Plain View *Key — Progeny* per N1).

## Action taken
This agent **stood down** to preserve **L4 (one serial CL lane)** and avoid write races on
`content/cases/*`, `ingest-queue.md`, and `cl-calls.log`. It made **no writes** to case pages, the queue,
or the call log, and stopped issuing CL calls. The other lane was left as the sole owner of batch 4.

## State at stand-down
- **Authored by the active lane (9/18):** Chadwick, Cardwell v. Lewis, Michigan v. Thomas, Florida v.
  Meyers, Maryland v. Dyson, Cooper v. California, Florida v. White, Harris v. United States (1968),
  Cupp v. Murphy — all ✅ in the queue.
- **Remaining (9/18), not yet authored at stand-down:** Michigan v. Tyler, Michigan v. Clifford,
  Thompson v. Louisiana, Flippo v. West Virginia, Ryburn v. Huff, **Case v. Montana**, Go-Bart Importing
  Co. v. United States, Agnello v. United States, Shipley v. California. The active lane was progressing
  through these in file order.

## Recommended resolution
1. **Confirm exactly ONE lane owns batch 4** and let it finish the remaining 9 — do **not** run two.
2. If the other lane has since **stalled** (verify via `ingest-queue.md` ✅ progress + `cl-calls.log`
   freshness), re-dispatch **a single** lane to complete only the still-unauthored remainder.
3. Verified reference material this agent gathered for the remaining 9 (identity, lead opinion_id,
   verbatim pinpoint quotes) is in this agent's final report and can seed whichever single lane finishes,
   to save duplicate CL calls — notably **Case v. Montana** is confirmed: cluster 10774335 → lead
   **opinion_id 11240920**, *607 U.S. ___ (2026)* (slip), No. 24-624, Kagan J. unanimous, decided
   2026-01-14; holds Brigham City's objective-reasonableness emergency-aid standard applies **without a
   probable-cause gloss**; affirmed. Home **[[Community Caretaking and Emergency Aid]]** (SCOTUS ⇒ Key per
   N5, though the queue hint says "Progeny").

## RESOLVED-BY-COMPLETION (stamped 2026-07-22, P5, RULING P5-02(b))
S5-era stand-down note; the 9 affected pages measured complete-to-spec (P5-R12 register
review). No open work remains under this escalation.
